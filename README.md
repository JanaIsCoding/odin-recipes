# odin-recipes

This is a project in which I will create a Website about a few of my favourite recipes.

For each recipe, I will provide:
- a picture of the serving
- nutritional values
- written recipe 
- link to a video of the recipe 
- more things perhaps.

At the end of this project I will have demonstrated the following skills: 
- writing HTML code for the Website 
- styling with CSS code
- learning the Git workflow and how to write good commit messages

Thanks for reading! :)
