        Caprese is the name for a simple Italian salad made of sliced tomatoes, sliced mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves. 
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The colors are meant to represent the red, white, and green of the Italian flag. 
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The salad is typically served with olive oil and some kind of vinegar.

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut the large tomatoes into approximately 1/4-inch slices. Use a serrated knife for the cleanest cuts.</li>
        <li>Cut the fresh mozzarella cheese into 1/4 inch slices.</li>
        <li>Salt the sliced tomatoes generously with kosher salt and set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the balsamic vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan. Cook on medium low heat and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes or until thickened. Stir occasionally as it cooks and don't leave it unattended because it can easily scorch.</li>
        <li>Layer a salted tomato, then one to two basil leaves, followed by a slice of mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Keep layering these ingredients until you have filled up your platter. Drizzle with the olive oil, and more salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the balsamic vinegar glaze over the top of the salad and serve immediately.</li>
