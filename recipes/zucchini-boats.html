        Ingredients:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Zucchini</li>
        <li>Lean Ground Beef or Turkey</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Ricotta Cheese, Egg, Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First off, prepare the zucchini squash. Slice them lengthwise, stem to stern. Scoop out the insides, leaving a quarter inch rim. Discard what you scoop out. It will be mostly seeds. Put them, cut side down, on a paper towel to drain while you get the “stuffing” ready.</li>
        <li>Brown the meat in a skillet with onions, seasoning with salt and pepper. Add garlic and sauté briefly. Stir in spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix up the creamy ricotta stuffing. It's pretty much the same as what you find in lasagna: ricotta, egg, Parmesan, and herbs.</li>
        <li>Now you're ready to fill the boats. Divide the ricotta mixture evenly between the eight zucchini halves, spreading it out from end to end.</li>
        <li>Top that with the meaty sauce. Way easier than lasagna, right?</li>
        <li>Put the boats into a baking dish and bake until the zucchini is tender, about 35 minutes. Top with mozzarella, and bake for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
